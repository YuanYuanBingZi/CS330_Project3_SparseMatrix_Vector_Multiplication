# CS330_Project3_SparseMatrix_Vector_Multiplication
This project implements sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) in C, converting a matrix from COO to CSR format for efficient computation. It reads/writes matrices and vectors in Matrix Market format, ensuring O(N) conversion time and handling large matrices with floating-point precision considerations.
